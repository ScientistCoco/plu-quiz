### What is this:
A quiz app that can be used by cashiers at Harris Farm Markets to quickly develop their knowledge in the fruit & vegetable department. Developed to overcome the manual process of having to memorise with the traditional method of pen and paper.

### Why was this made:
- To improve on the inital design which used python-flask and very minimal javascript for hosting, this resulted in slow page load times.
- To dwelve into the Redux library to get a better understanding of how it works.
